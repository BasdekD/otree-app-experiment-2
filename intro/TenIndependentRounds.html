        Low-income members are given <b>ten independent chances (ten rounds)</b> to increase their income.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u><b>Each new round is independent of what happened in previous rounds.</b></u><br/>
        In each new round, the <b>initial income</b> of the <b>low-income</b> group is <b>£{{ session.config.low_income }}</b>
        and the <b>initial income</b> of the <b>high-income</b> group is <b>£{{ session.config.high_income }}.</b><br/>
        In each new round, each low-income member is endowed with <b>{{ session.config.initial_action_points }} Action
        Points</b> and must use these points in the three ways described before <b>to increase his/her income.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of each round, low-income members will <b>receive feedback about income redistribution</b> in this round
        and whether they <b>moved to the high-income group in this round.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Each participant will receive as bonus payment the final income of his group in one randomly selected round.</b>
